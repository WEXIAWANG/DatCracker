A .Dat to jpg decryption script

Originally used for Wechat DAT decryption I repurposed the script to accept the most common image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF) and batch convert them. I've seen a lot of sites charge for an initially very simple XOR flip of the bytes in these types of files so heres a free version.

Simply input a target directory in the “indir” var and an output directory in the “outdir” dir then run the script.

I may release a C# version in the future if people would like a simple GUI interface.
